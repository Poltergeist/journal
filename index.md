## Log: Today I Build - 2018-04-15 00:18:12 +0200

 Today I have build a Journal system based on git commit massages. After I did an empty commit I can
`git log` the massages into a mark down file which I deploy on github. I have a commit type for
excluding commits so that I can filter these out. This works actually pretty good. So now I have a
Journal which I can use without opening a browser :-) This is pretty cool.
